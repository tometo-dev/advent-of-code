Rust implementation of the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

The sole purpose of this repo is to help me with learning Rust ðŸ™‚

The concepts/techniques used to solve the problems are mostly taken from [@chrisbiscardi](https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi)'s YT tutorials, but are not copied.
